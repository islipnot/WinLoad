# WinLoad
- Detailing undocumented functionality from the Windows 10 image loader, primarily focused on module resolution and mapping.
- Currently targeting the x86 image loader.

## Credits
- [Geoffchappell.com](https://www.geoffchappell.com) is EXTREMELY helpful in understanding and reversing undocumented or partially documented Windows structures.
- [Paskalian:WID_LoadLibrary](https://github.com/paskalian/WID_LoadLibrary) has helped reverse certain aspects of the image loader, aswell as inspiring me to start this project.
