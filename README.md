# WinLoad
- Detailing undocumented functionality from the Windows 10 image loader, primarily focused on module resolution and mapping.
- Currently targeting the x86 image loader.
- This is purely documentation for now. In the future, I might add recreations of reversed functions.

## Credits
[Paskalian:WID_LoadLibrary](https://github.com/paskalian/WID_LoadLibrary) has been a great help in reversing certain aspects of the image loader, aswell as my inspiration for making this.
